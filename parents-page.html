                            Buying books that feature and promote diversity is a great first step. While the number of
                            books featuring or written by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) has certainly
                            increased in recent years, there is still much room for improvement.
                            <br>
                            According to the Cooperative Children’s Book Center, part of the School of Education,
                            University of Wisconsin-Madison, only about <strong>12%</strong> of children's books in 2019
                            prominantly included Black characters. There are more books with animals as main characters
                            than there
                            are of Black people.</p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="columns is-centered">
                            <div class="column is-two-thirds">
                                <div class="box">
                                    <img class="is-centered" src="assets/2019aboutpercentagechart.png"
                                        alt="Bar graph from CCBC showing the percentages of an ethnic group featured in children's books in 2018 and 2019" />

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            One way to go a step further is to intentionally purchase books written by BIPOC authors or
                            illustrated by BIPOC artists. Sales prove profitablity and drive publishers to print more
                            books.</p>

                                but there will be more and more books written and illustrated by people representing
                                their
                                own diverse communities.”<br>

                            <strong>When picking books, ask yourself a few questions.</strong>
                            <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i class="fas fa-question-circle"> Who tells the story?</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i class="fas fa-question-circle"> Is it an authenic story from a first hand knowledge of the culture?</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i class="fas fa-question-circle">
                                    Are minority characters merely background characters?</i></li>
                            <li>
                                <i class="fas fa-question-circle">
                                    Are there stereotypes or tropes used?</i>
                            </li>
                            <li><i class="fas fa-question-circle">
                                    Is it a "white savior" narrative?</i>
                            </li>
                            <li><i class="fas fa-question-circle">
                                    What larger conversation can come from this story?</i>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Don't shy away from those hard conversations. The more we normalize these topics, the less taboo
                        they become.
